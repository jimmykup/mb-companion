		<h2>3.9.5 â€“ July 31st, 2020</h2>

		<h3>New Features</h3>

		<h4>Email Viewer UI</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a (?) shortcut icon to the "Info Overlay" in the top bar.
			<li>Info Overlay now has a close button in the upper right hand corner.
			<li>You can now shrink (or less likely, expand) your desktop email preview to fit to the screen. Helpful to get a quick look at your entire email.
			<li>Info Overlay has been updated to show more of the shortcuts available to you.
		</ul>

		<h4>Email QA</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A large block of "spam" words that we use to highlight have been removed. Further research has proven that inbox placement has very little to do with supposed "spam" words so pointing them out in the email preview is unecessary.
		</ul>

		<h4>Other</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Created a "What's New" page that pulls in the changelog for the extension. It opens when the extension is updated and also appears in the "Info Overlay" when viewing an email.
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to toggle link markers on and off wasn't working because of some renaming of elements.
		</ul>

		<h3>Maintenance</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added back in permissions that allowed us to access any page on the internet. It was previously removed because Google has been cracking down on extensions requesting more permissions than they need. After attempting to tighten up our manifest it became clear that we would need those broader permissions.
			<li>Moved all zoom related code to it's own .js file for better organization.
		</ul>
